task_name: test-login-workflow
objective: Create comprehensive automated test suite for user authentication login workflow covering happy paths, error handling, security scenarios, and edge cases
requirements:
  - Implement unit tests for login validation logic (email format, password requirements, input sanitization)
  - Implement integration tests for complete login flow (authentication, session creation, redirects)
  - Implement security tests for common vulnerabilities (XSS, SQL injection, rate limiting, password exposure)
  - Test error handling for invalid credentials, empty fields, non-existent users
  - Test edge cases including long inputs, special characters, simultaneous logins, expired sessions
  - Use existing pytest framework with fixtures and mocks
  - Mock external dependencies (database, Supabase Auth API calls)
  - Achieve >80% test coverage for login functionality
  - All tests must be isolated, repeatable, and fast (<5 seconds for unit tests)
  - Follow existing test patterns in codebase (pytest conventions, fixture usage)
files_to_modify:
  - None (only adding test files, no production code changes)
new_files:
  - tests/test_login_validation.py
  - tests/test_login_integration.py
  - tests/test_login_security.py
  - tests/fixtures/auth_fixtures.py
  - tests/conftest.py
  - tests/README.md
implementation_steps:
  - Step 1: Create pytest configuration in tests/conftest.py with shared fixtures (mock Supabase client, test users, auth responses)
  - Step 2: Create tests/fixtures/auth_fixtures.py with sample valid/invalid user data, authentication responses, and mock utilities
  - Step 3: Implement tests/test_login_validation.py for unit tests (email validation, password validation, input sanitization, empty field checks)
  - Step 4: Implement tests/test_login_integration.py for full login flow (successful login, session persistence, token storage, redirects, logout scenarios)
  - Step 5: Implement tests/test_login_security.py for security scenarios (XSS prevention, SQL injection blocking, rate limiting, password masking, secure error messages)
  - Step 6: Create tests/README.md documenting how to run tests, what each test file covers, and how to add new tests
  - Step 7: Run pytest with coverage report to verify >80% coverage target
  - Step 8: Ensure all tests pass and execute in <5 seconds for unit tests
testing_requirements:
  - All test files must use pytest framework with descriptive test names (test_valid_email_login_succeeds)
  - Use pytest fixtures for test data setup and teardown
  - Mock Supabase authentication API calls using pytest-mock or unittest.mock
  - Include pytest markers for test categories (@pytest.mark.unit, @pytest.mark.integration, @pytest.mark.security)
  - Test coverage report generated via pytest-cov plugin
  - Each test must have clear assertions with descriptive failure messages
  - Use parametrize decorator for testing multiple input variations efficiently
  - Include both positive and negative test cases for each requirement
  - Tests must clean up any test data/state after execution
constraints:
  - Do NOT modify any production code in src/ directory
  - Do NOT modify existing authentication logic or Supabase integration
  - Do NOT add new production dependencies (only dev/test dependencies like pytest-cov if missing)
  - Follow pytest naming conventions (test_*.py files, test_* functions)
  - Use existing mock patterns from codebase if any exist
  - Tests must be runnable via simple 'pytest' command
  - Do NOT commit sensitive credentials or API keys in test fixtures
  - Error messages in tests should not expose implementation details
  - Follow Python 3.11+ type hints in test code
  - Use pathlib.Path for file paths in tests if needed
  - Maintain test isolation (no test should depend on another test's execution)
